# DPIA â€” Data Protection Impact Assessment (Skeleton + Checklist)

### **1. Description of Processing**
* **Purpose**: To shortlist and pre-select candidates according to the RUR 1.0 protocol.
* **Data Categories**: Aggregated metrics from `Org Truth Packet`, non-negotiable requirements from `Needs Capsule`, VRF logs, and process metadata. No sensitive personal data is processed by default.
* **Recipients**: Participating organizations (limited, pseudonymized data); Ethical Panel (aggregated data only).

### **2. Legal Basis**
* The processing is based on the performance of a contract (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR) with the participants and the legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) of creating a fair and efficient recruitment market.
* Information about the logic involved in the automated decision-making process (VRF lottery, lane allocation) is provided to all participants.

### **3. Minimization and Retention**
* Data collection is minimized to what is strictly necessary. Data is aggregated into "buckets" to protect privacy.
* Data retention is set to 90 days, after which all personal data is deleted or fully anonymized.
* The principle of progressive disclosure is applied throughout the protocol.

### **4. Risks and Mitigating Measures**
* **Risk of Discrimination**: Mitigated by anti-bias rules, audits (CF-7), blinding the system to protected characteristics, and providing a human-in-the-loop for appeals.
* **Risk of `Org Truth Packet` Manipulation**: Mitigated by audits (CF-6), digital signatures (SD-JWT/BBS+), and reputational consequences.
* **Risk of Data Breach**: Mitigated by end-to-end encryption, access control, and other security measures outlined in `15_security_retention.md`.

### **5. Decision**
* [ ] Accept residual risk
* [ ] Mitigation required (describe)
* [ ] Consult with the Data Protection Authority (if risk remains high)
