# Spec: Compatibility Report (Light)

### **Definition**
The Compatibility Report is a lightweight, two-way summary presented to both the candidate and the organization after the initial, automated matching phase. Its purpose is not to provide a "score" or "rank," but to create a transparent basis for the `Mutual Veto` decision. It is a map of alignment and potential friction.

### **Axes of Comparison**
The report is structured around a few key, non-discriminatory axes derived from the `Org Truth Packet` and the `Needs Capsule`:

1.  **Work Rhythm**: Compares the candidate's preferences for `Work Mode` (remote/hybrid/on-site) and `Time Flexibility` with the organization's declared reality.
2.  **Autonomy & Growth**: Compares the candidate's preference for `Mentoring` and `Pace of Growth` with signals from the organization's data (e.g., `Average Tenure in Role`).
3.  **Communication**: Compares the candidate's preferred `Communication Style` (async/sync) with the organization's work mode.
4.  **Values (Proxy)**: Compares signals of what the organization values (e.g., high `Overtime` might signal a "hustle culture") with the candidate's non-negotiable boundaries.
5.  **Team Rituals**: A placeholder for future versions where team-specific practices can be declared.

### **Output Format**
For each axis, the report provides a simple, non-numeric status:

* **Aligned**: Indicates strong compatibility.
* **Partially Aligned**: Indicates potential for discussion or compromise.
* **Conflict**: Indicates a fundamental mismatch based on a non-negotiable requirement.

The report also highlights **1-2 key points of potential friction** for both parties to consider.

### **Process Flow**
1.  After the 3-lane allocation is complete, the report is generated for each shortlisted candidate.
2.  Both the candidate and the organization receive their respective, symmetrically presented reports.
3.  A window opens for the **`Mutual Veto`**. Either party can anonymously and without reputational penalty choose not to proceed. The other party is only informed that "incompatibility was detected," not who made the decision.
4.  If neither party exercises the veto, the process moves to the `Ritual of Slowness`.
