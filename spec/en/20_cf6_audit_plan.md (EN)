# CF-6 Audit Plan (Methodology)

### **Objective**
To detect and act upon significant manipulation of the `Org Truth Packet` data provided by participating organizations, thereby ensuring the integrity of the RUR protocol.

### **Sampling**
* **Scope**: A sample of participating organizations will be selected for a privacy-preserving audit.
* **Size**: The sample size will be at least **20% of the total number of organizations** in the pilot, with a minimum of **2 organizations** per cohort.
* **Selection**: The selection will be randomized.

### **Secondary Data Sources**
The audit will compare the declared "buckets" with estimates derived from ethically sourced and anonymized secondary data. Potential sources include:
* Aggregated tenure/retention data estimated from public professional profiles (e.g., LinkedIn).
* Voluntary submission of internal, anonymized HR statistics by the organization.
* Publicly available reports or employee reviews (used as a qualitative signal).

### **Methodology**
1.  For each sampled organization, an independent estimate for each of the 5 metrics will be generated based on the secondary data.
2.  The estimate will be compared to the declared "bucket."
3.  A **discrepancy** is flagged if the estimate falls outside the declared bucket by more than an acceptable margin of error (defined at ±10% to account for data noise).
4.  The **pause criterion** for CF-6 is met if a significant discrepancy (`>20%` deviation) is confirmed in `≥1` metric for `>2` organizations.

### **Procedure**
1.  The audit is conducted by a designated, independent party or a subcommittee of the Ethical Panel.
2.  If the pause criterion is met, a formal report is submitted to the full Ethical Panel.
3.  The Ethical Panel reviews the report and holds the final authority to pause the pilot.
4.  The decision and a summary of the findings are published in the public changelog.
