# RUR 1.0 Protocol Specification (Invariants)

### **Scope**
This protocol governs the shortlisting and pre-selection phase of the recruitment process, ending with an invitation to a synchronous interview.

### **Invariants (MUST)**
The protocol is defined by the following mandatory, non-negotiable components:

1.  **Symmetrical Disclosure**:
    * Organizations **MUST** provide a complete and truthful `Org Truth Packet`.
    * Candidates **MUST** provide their non-negotiable requirements in a `Needs Capsule`.
2.  **Fair Allocation**:
    * The shortlisting process **MUST** be conducted using the 3-lane allocation system (Lottery, Relational, Equity).
    * The random component of the allocation **MUST** use a Verifiable Random Function (VRF) with a public beacon, and a "receipt" **MUST** be issued to each candidate.
3.  **Mutual Agency**:
    * Both parties **MUST** be presented with a `Compatibility Report` before a synchronous interview is proposed.
    * Both parties **MUST** have an equal and reputation-free right to `Mutual Veto` after reviewing the report.
4.  **Reflective Process**:
    * The process **MUST** include a `Ritual of Slowness` (asynchronous exchange) with a minimum duration (e.g., 24h/48h) and a message limit (e.g., 3 exchanges).
    * The format of the ritual **MUST** be rotated to prevent script-based optimization.

### **Prohibitions (MUST NOT)**

1.  The protocol **MUST NOT** use protected characteristics (age, gender, etc.) or biometric data (micro-expressions, voice analysis) for decision-making.
2.  The user interface **MUST NOT** employ "dark patterns" to influence user choices.

### **Core Process Flow**

1.  **Role Publication**: The organization publishes a role, defining the `Org Truth Packet`, the pilot mode (`FAST`/`FULL`), and the application deadline.
2.  **Application**: Candidates submit their `Needs Capsule` and verifiable evidence of their qualifications (via VC/SD-JWT/BBS+).
3.  **Allocation**: After the deadline, the system verifies the minimum requirements, assigns candidates to one of the three lanes, and conducts the verifiable lottery, issuing a `VRF Receipt` to all participants.
4.  **Compatibility & Veto**: The shortlisted candidates and the organization receive the `Compatibility Report`. A window for `Mutual Veto` is opened.
5.  **Ritual of Slowness**: The remaining pairs enter the asynchronous exchange phase.
6.  **Invitation**: After the ritual is complete, the organization can send an invitation for a synchronous meeting.
