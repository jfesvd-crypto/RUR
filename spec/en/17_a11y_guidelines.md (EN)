# Accessibility Guidelines (A11y)

### **Core Principles**
Any user interface implementing the RUR protocol **MUST** adhere to the principles of universal design to ensure it is accessible to people with a wide range of abilities.

1.  **Equivalent Paths**: For all `Rituals of Slowness`, the system **MUST** provide equivalent alternative modalities. If a task is presented visually (e.g., a diagram), a text-based or audio alternative must be available. Users must be able to choose their preferred mode of interaction (text, audio, video) without penalty.

2.  **WCAG Compliance**: The interface **MUST** meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA standard. This includes, but is not limited to:
    * **Contrast and Fonts**: Sufficient color contrast and scalable text.
    * **Keyboard Navigation**: All functionality must be operable via a keyboard.
    * **Screen Reader Support**: The interface must be compatible with modern screen readers, using proper semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.

3.  **Flexible Timing**: Users **MUST** have the ability to request an extension for timed sections of the protocol (like the `Rituals of Slowness`) to accommodate disabilities or specific needs.
