# Declaration of Ambition: RUR 1.0 → RUR 2.0

### Vision: From Minimal Symmetry to Full Symbiosis

The RUR project is an evolutionary process with two distinct phases:

* **RUR 1.0 (The Pilot: `Latarnia-EC01`)**: The goal is to establish **minimal symmetry**. We are introducing a protocol with mandatory, auditable rules (`Org Truth Packet`, `Needs Capsule`, `Mutual Veto`) that create a fairer process within the existing recruitment paradigm.
* **RUR 2.0 (The Vision: "Symphony")**: The long-term goal is to achieve a **symbiotic protocol**. This phase envisions a future where fiduciary AI agent ecosystems, representing both the candidate and the organization, conduct mutual due diligence.

### North Star

Our guiding principle is not to eliminate performance, but to **change the incentives so that it pays to perform honesty.**

### Horizons

* **0–6 months**: Deploy and test RUR 1.0 via a controlled pilot, gathering data and falsifying our core assumptions.
* **6–18+ months**: Based on the success of the pilot, begin development of the RUR 2.0 protocol and sandbox environment for agent-to-agent negotiation.

### Limits of Responsibility

RUR assumes that theater and performance are ineliminable from social relations. **Our goal is not their elimination, but to change what is profitable to perform.** RUR does not solve the fundamental power asymmetry in the economy, nor does it guarantee "authenticity." It minimizes the harmful effects of the current system and makes the rules of the game explicit.

### Definition of Success (5-Year Horizon)

Success is not a single outcome, but a two-tiered achievement:
1.  **Reform**: The principles of RUR 1.0 (minimal symmetry) become a recognized standard, integrated as a "Fair Shortlist Mode" in major ATS/marketplaces.
2.  **Transformation**: Niche implementations of the full RUR 2.0 symbiosis protocol are live and successful within forward-thinking communities (e.g., DAOs, open-source projects, co-ops).
