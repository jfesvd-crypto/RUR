# RUR 1.0 Manifesto: A Protocol for a Fairer Theater

**RUR is not a recruitment platform. It is a protocol for gradually restoring symmetry in the relationship between organizations and people.** We accept that the "theater" of recruitment is unavoidable. Our goal is not to eliminate performance, but to change what it's profitable to perform.

In the RUR protocol, it pays to perform honesty, because deception is detectable and costly.

### Core Principles

1.  **Transparency & Auditability**: The rules of the shortlisting process must be public, stable, and verifiable. Every candidate has the right to a "receipt from the lottery" (VRF Receipt) that proves the process was fair and auditable.

2.  **Privacy & Minimal Disclosure**: The candidate's data is their own. The protocol is built on the principle of progressive disclosure, using tools like Verifiable Credentials. We reject the paradigm of harvesting data; we build a system of verifiable claims.

3.  **Symmetry of Information**: The fundamental power imbalance in recruitment stems from information asymmetry. RUR attacks this at its core by making two things mandatory:
    * **Org Truth Packet**: Organizations must disclose key, verifiable metrics about their real work culture.
    * **Needs Capsule**: Candidates must clearly state their non-negotiable needs from the start.

4.  **Fairness over Speed**: We reject the "fastest-first" model that rewards speed and aggression. The 3-lane allocation system ensures that selection is a function of genuine fit, contribution, and a fair, random chanceâ€”not the speed of an AI agent.

5.  **Reflection over Reaction**: High-stakes decisions require thoughtfulness. The protocol's **Rituals of Slowness** are a deliberate feature, not a bug. They create a space for reflection, reducing the risk of decisions based on bias and first impressions.

### Our Promise

RUR does not promise a perfect, bias-free world. It promises a **fairer theater with transparent rules**. It provides a framework where both parties can make informed decisions based on more symmetrical information, and where the incentives are aligned with long-term compatibility, not short-term performance.

This is an open standard. We invite you to test it, critique it, and help us build a better way to connect.
