# RUR â€” A Fair Recruitment Framework

**RUR is not a platform; it's a protocol designed to restore symmetry and fairness to the recruitment processes in the age of AI agents. Our goal is not to eliminate the "theater" of recruitment, but to change what it's profitable to perform. In RUR, it pays to perform honesty.**

## The Problem

The rise of autonomous AI agents threatens to turn recruitment into a chaotic "Bot War," where speed and aggression trump merit. Simultaneously, traditional recruitment remains an "unfair theater," a game with opaque rules that perpetuates structural inequality.

## The Solution: RUR 1.0 Protocol

RUR (Ramy Uczciwej Rekrutacji - Fair Recruitment Framework) introduces a set of auditable, mandatory rules to create a more symmetrical and transparent process.

### Key Mechanisms:
1.  **Org Truth Packet**: Organizations must verifiably disclose key metrics about their work culture.
2.  **Needs Capsule**: Candidates clearly state their non-negotiable requirements.
3.  **3-Lane Allocation**: A fair, partially randomized shortlisting process (using VRF) that values fit and equity over speed.
4.  **Compatibility Report & Mutual Veto**: Both parties receive a compatibility report and have an equal right to withdraw.
5.  **Rituals of Slowness**: The protocol intentionally introduces asynchronous steps to encourage reflection over reaction.

## Project Status

This repository contains the complete theoretical package for the RUR 1.0 protocol, including the manifesto, technical specifications, and a methodology for testing (**Falsification Protocol**).

The project is currently in the conceptual phase, ready for a pilot implementation (`Latarnia-EC01`).

## How to Contribute

This is an open project. We welcome discussion, critique, and collaboration. Please start by reading the **[Manifesto](spec/en/01_manifest.md)** and the **[Full Protocol Specification](spec/en/05_spec_rur_v1.md)**.
