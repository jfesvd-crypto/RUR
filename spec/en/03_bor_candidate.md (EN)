# Candidate Bill of Rights (RUR 1.0)

By participating in a recruitment process that uses the RUR 1.0 protocol, you are guaranteed the following rights:

### **Right to Transparency and Auditability**
You have the right to know the rules of the selection process before you apply. You have the right to receive a verifiable "receipt from the lottery" (VRF Receipt) that proves the shortlisting process was conducted fairly and according to the stated rules.

### **Right to Privacy and Minimal Disclosure**
You have the right to participate in the initial stages of the process without revealing unnecessary personal information. The protocol requires you to prove your qualifications, not to surrender your data. Information is disclosed progressively and only with your consent.

### **Right to Symmetry**
You have the right to an informed decision. You will have access to the organization's `Org Truth Packet`, which contains key, verifiable metrics about its work culture, just as the organization has access to your `Needs Capsule`.

### **Right to a Fair Chance**
You have the right to be evaluated based on your fit and qualifications, not on the speed of your application. The 3-lane allocation system is designed to give all suitable candidates a fair chance, mitigating the biases of a "fastest-first" approach.

### **Right to Mutual Veto**
You have the right to withdraw from the process after the initial compatibility assessment, just as the organization does. This is a mutual decision, and your choice to withdraw carries no reputational penalty.

### **Right to Dignity and Reflection**
You have the right to be treated with respect. The protocol's `Rituals of Slowness` are designed to create a space for thoughtful interaction, free from the pressure of immediate, performative responses. Your use of AI assistance in crafting your responses is accepted and can be openly declared.

### **Reciprocity Clause**
By participating, you agree to the protocol's principle of reciprocity: both parties commit to disclosing the information required by the protocol and accept that the other party has the right to make a decision based on that information, including ending the process due to incompatibility.
