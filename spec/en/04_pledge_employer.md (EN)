# Employer Pledge (RUR 1.0)

By using the RUR 1.0 protocol to source and shortlist candidates, your organization commits to the following principles:

### **Commitment to Transparency and Honesty**
You pledge to provide a truthful and accurate `Org Truth Packet`, representing the five key metrics of your work culture to the best of your ability. You accept that this data is a condition of participation and agree to cooperate with randomized, privacy-preserving audits to verify its integrity.

### **Commitment to Fairness**
You pledge to honor the outcomes of the 3-lane allocation process. You accept that the shortlisting process is governed by the auditable rules of the protocol, which combines meritorious fit with a verifiable random function (VRF) to ensure fairness.

### **Commitment to Respect and Dignity**
You pledge to create a respectful environment during the `Rituals of Slowness`. You agree not to use AI tools for biometric analysis (micro-expressions, voice sentiment) of candidates during any interaction.

### **Commitment to Symmetry**
You pledge to respect the candidate's `Needs Capsule` and their right to a `Mutual Veto`. You accept that the goal of the process is to find mutual compatibility, not simply to fill a position.

### **Reciprocity Clause**
By participating, you agree to the protocol's principle of reciprocity: both parties commit to disclosing the information required by the protocol and accept that the other party has the right to make a decision based on that information, including ending the process due to incompatibility. Your decision to veto carries no reputational penalty for the candidate.
